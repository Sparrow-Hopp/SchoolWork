Day 1: Made sprites, programmed movement
Day 2: Programmed lasers
Day 3: Added enemies
Day 4: Added health, sound effects, animations, timer, and start screen
Day 5: Trying to figure out why my scripts aren't working

Motivations: The concept of a vertical shooter reminds me of a mminigame I used to play when I was little where you had to protect a farm from invading birds.
Improvements: If I had more time I'd add better animations and probably a better UI as well.

How to play:
-AD or left/right arrow to move
-spacebar to jump
-left click (M1) to fire
