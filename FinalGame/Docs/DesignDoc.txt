The game is going to be a dungeon crawler centered around magic.

-select different classes (?)
-pixel art (maybe 32 bit)
-range magic, close quarters magic, and support magic
-enemies get harder the higher level you go
	-enemy level is randomly generated based on your level (always at max 2 above)
	-enemy stats scale with level
-earn points per enemy defeated (xp)
-unlock spells as you level up
-enemies are plants (some ranged some melee)
	-only one enemy type per level, but difficulty rating can change
-story incorporated into tutorial (?)

-levels infinitely generate
	-at different levels scenery changes and enemies change
    		-forest
   		-desert
   		-mountain/snow with a final boss
			-final boss uses magic spells character has gained
   	-each scenery is a different scene so that enemies can change, player stats will stay the way they are

TUTORIAL

	-use signs/"npcs" to tell the player the core mechanics
		-on collision with signs, if player presses a button it reads out a text blurb, press a key to close it
	-introduce movement mechanics
	-present dummy enemies the player can practice killing
		-dummy enemies give no xp
	-tell the player the base story and direct them to the main game


LEVELS

	-enemies spawn in random position inside spawn box
		-different types of enemies have different movement patterns
		-different types of enemies have different attacks
			-melee enemies move towards you
			-ranged enemies move in random pattern, but attacks go towards you (not seeking)
	-previous level box gets deleted when new level box is created

GAME OVER SCENE

	-tell the player they died
	-tell the player what level they were and how many enemies they defeated
	-ask them if they want to play again


OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS (will write answers under question):

-could I use art that isn't my own if I'm not capable of creating art in the style I want?
	-some premade sprites
	-no more than half custom sprites
-how do I make a level infinitely generate?
	-generate more level
		-create block prefab
	-have prefab of entire area
		-call it "room"
		-has collider on top and bottom
		-on collision enter spawn in new block
	-maybe delete old room to conserve data space
		-use lists?
-how to create a health/mana UI that changes scale with health/mana lost/gained?
-how to make rolling animation smoother?
