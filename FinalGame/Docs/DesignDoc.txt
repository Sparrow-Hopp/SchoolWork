The game is going to be a dungeon crawler centered around magic.

-pixel art (maybe 32 bit)
-range magic
-enemies get harder the higher level you go
	-enemy level is randomly generated based on your level (always at max 2 above)
	-enemy stats scale with level
-earn points per enemy defeated (xp)
-enemies are plants (some ranged some melee)
	-only one enemy type per level, but difficulty rating can change

-levels infinitely generate
	-at different levels scenery changes and enemies change
    		-forest
   		-desert
   		-mountain/snow with a final boss
			-final boss uses same magic spells as character
   	-each scenery is a different scene so that enemies can change, player stats will stay the way they are

TUTORIAL

	-use signs/"npcs" to tell the player the core mechanics
		-on collision with signs it reads out a text blurb
	-introduce movement mechanics


LEVELS

	-enemies spawn in random position inside spawn box
	-previous level box gets deleted when new level box is created

GAME OVER SCENE

	-tell the player they died
	-tell the player what level they were
	-ask them if they want to play again

	-no more than half custom sprites
-how do I make a level infinitely generate?
	-generate more level
		-create block prefab
	-have prefab of entire area
		-call it "room"
		-has collider on top and bottom
		-on collision enter spawn in new block
	-maybe delete old room to conserve data space
		-use lists?
-how to create a health/mana UI that changes scale with health lost/gained?
	-masking
	-adjusting the UI slider
