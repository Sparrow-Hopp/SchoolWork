The game is going to be a dungeon crawler centered around magic.

-select different classes (?)
-pixel art (maybe 32 bit)
-range magic, close quarters magic, and support magic
-enemies get harder the higher level you go
-earn points per enemy defeated (xp)
-unlock spells as you level up
-enemies are plants (some ranged some melee)
-story incorporated into tutorial (?)

-levels infinitely generate
-at different levels scenery changes and enemies change
