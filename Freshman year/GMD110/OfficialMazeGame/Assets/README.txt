Daily Updates:
Day 1: Finished creating maze 1
Day 2 part 1: Finished creating maze 2, hoping to get the player moving by the end of the day and the triggers working
Day 2 part 2: Base game coded, need to add deactivating walls and timer
Day 3 part 1: Added deactivating walls with trigger
Day 3 part 2: Added timer system
Day 4 part 1: Made camera follow player

Controls:
~use directional keys to move player (red circle)
~reach finish line marked by a star
~must hit triggers marked by triangles to open pathways
~reach the end of the maze before the timer reaches 0

If I had more time...:
~established the control switching mechanic I wanted to (I tried but couldn't figure out the code but if I had more time I probably could've figured it out)
