Use M1 to move player
Position yourself to eat the foods flying towards the edges of the grid
Eating healthy food adds timer to timer depending on food eaten, eating junk food will ALWAYS remove 3 seconds from timer if eaten
After eating ANY food the speed of the food increases
Avocados add five seconds to your timer
Carrots add three seconds to your timer
Tomatoes add three seconds to your timer AND add additional speed to the food

Good Luck!
