Concept Design for Paint the Walls Red

Main premise of platformer: use projectile attacks to modify the terrain
-red: bouncy
-blue: icy
-yellow/orange: sticky
-purple: ghost (pass through) 
Player is controlled through WASD movement (space to jump), weapon is a paintbrush that follows mouse movement
Cycle through attacks using M2 (right click)
Fire projectiles using M1 (left click)
Make all ground types, enemies (if I decide to add enemies), and projectiles prefabs
Add sound effects to launching projectiles and projectiles making contact with walls
Add idle animations, walking animations, and attack animations

Bonus if I have time: create a story for the game which is incorporated into a tutorial on how to play
